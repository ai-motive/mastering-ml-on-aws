# mastering-ml-on-aws
In this repo you can find notebooks and code snippets included in the following book:

*Mastering Machine Learning on AWS by Saket Mengle and Maximo Gurmendez.*

The book can be obtained through Amazon or Packt:

https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Machine-Learning-AWS-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07QC3QPXY/

https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-machine-learning-aws

Intentionally the notebooks have no markdown as we believe the best way to understand the code flow is by following the sections in the text.

Hope you enjoy the book and we look forward to your feedback!
